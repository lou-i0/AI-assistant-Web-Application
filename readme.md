# Web Application with Open AI's AI Assistant - WAOA

## Introduction
The Idea of this (WAOA) was to learn a few things:

- How to create a web application using the python library - streamlit.
- Additionally, how to use a AI assistant API from open AI; and understand how that works within the Web application.

This work conducted here will go toward my understanding of a way to create a web app. Furthermore, the use of the ai assistant will provide a predicate into how a llm can be used, created and applied into a useful scenario - to help me learn for future work.

The Assistant API has benefits such a level of abstraction from an llm , but keeping conversation context, and adding more data to enrich the knowledge base. Additionally, it will be able to access multiple tools ion parallel to do stuff. There is some more info here that explains more in a visual format:

the assistant API can be set up with a defined characteristic and capabilities and more in comparison to the chat completions api as shown in the below screenshot:

## Getting Started

Instructions on how to install and run the project. Include any dependencies and prerequisites.

### dependencies /  pre-requisites
1. Before going further to either using or creating this web application, I needed to create an api key for the ai assistant from Open AI in which to use later. To do this: 
    1. Go to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
    2. Log in to your account (or create one!)
    3. Click on API on the right hand side 
    4. This will bring you to the main api page. From there, click on API keys (that is a little lock icon on the left hand side).
