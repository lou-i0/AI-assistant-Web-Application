# Web Application with Open AI's AI Assistant - WAOA

## Introduction
The Idea of this (WAOA) was to learn a few things:

- How to create a web application using the python library - streamlit.
- Additionally, how to use a AI assistant API from open AI; and understand how that works within the Web application.

This work conducted here will go toward my understanding of a way to create a web app. Furthermore, the use of the ai assistant will provide a predicate into how a llm can be used, created and applied into a useful scenario - to help me learn for future work.
